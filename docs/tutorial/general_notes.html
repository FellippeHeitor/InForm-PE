<a name="Font - form designer"></a>
<h2>Font - form designer .frm </h2>

<p>In the form designer, if you click the label that says <b>Font:</b> to the left of the font list, the list will turn into a text field where you can manually enter a font file name.<br>
It works, but some care must be taken:</p>

<ul>
   <li>The font file must be in the same folder as UiEditor.exe (or must be installed on the Windows system), so Inform will find it at edit time.   </li>
   <li>The font file must be in the same folder as the.EXE file from your project. If not, the default VGA font will be used instead.   </li>
</ul>

<a name="Inform editing"></a>
<h2>Inform editing</h2>
<p>If you wish to just edit the <b>.frm</b> file without affecting the .bas file, you can go to the Save dialog (File->Save project as) and check "Don't save .bas project (save .frm only)".<br>
If you do that, the .bas file will remain unchanged, but in this case, you should manually add the DIM lines for whatever new controls you may have added.</p>

<a name="Multi forms"></a>
<h2>Multi forms</h2>

<p>Multiple forms being controlled by the same application are not possible without some sort of "hack," for example.<br> InForm main editor interface is one program, and the form you edit is another program. <br>Both run simultaneously and exchange data through a local TCP/IP connection to each other.</p>

<a name="Splash Screen"></a>
<h2>Splash Screen</h2>

<p>Because QB64 is limited to a single window, the way to implment a splash screen is to have a PictureBox control covering all controls at the start until your load routines are finished. Then you set its .Hidden property to true and carry on.</p>


<a name="Screen resize"></a>
<h2>Screen resize</h2>

<p>Use the following to resize the screen:</p>
<pre><code tabindex="0">Control(__UI_FormID).Width = (whatever width suits you)
Control(__UI_FormID).Height = (whatever height suits you)</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, you can set a form's CanResize property to true so the user can freely resize the form. That will trigger the __UI_FormResize event, from which you can adapt your interface according to the resulting Control(__UI_FormID).Width and Control(__UI_FormID).Height.</p>

<p>Try creating a dummy empty form in the editor and just set the CanResize property to True as indicated above.<br>
You will see InForm will automatically add $RESIZE to the .frm file and that the _RESIZE event will be automatically caught and generate a call to the __UI_FormResize event, which will have filled the width and height properties of the Control(__UI_FormID) with the values of _RESIZEWIDTH and _RESIZEHEIGHT that you will use to reposition your controls accordingly.</p>


<a name="Button focus is active"></a>
<h2>Button focus is active</h2>

<p>A button that has received focus reacts to a carriage return by executing the code that is placed under that button's __UI_ClickÂ 
It is a normal response. You can also activate a focused button with the space bar, as it's standard behavior across Windows versions.</p>

<p>If you create a button with a caption hotkey (by adding an ampersand character before the &Desired letter), you can also activate it with Alt+Letter at runtime.</p>

<p>Also, set a button as default (by right-clicking it->"Set as default" at design time) and it'll also respond to Enter even if the button doesn't have focus (say your user is editing a text field and hits enter).</p>

<a name="Masked text"></a>
<h2>Masked text</h2>

<p>If you have Mask(TextBox1) = "0.0E00" in your program, InForm will only allow the user to enter numbers in that text field, and they will replace those zeros. The dot and the E will remain in place.</p>

<p>You can see that in action in the editor. As soon as you enter "0.0E00" as a mask to a TextBox control, the Text property will be bound to the new format. It'll show "_._E__" providing a feel for how it works.</p>
